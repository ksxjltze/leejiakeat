	<h1>About Me</h1>

		Hello there. My name is Jia Keat, I’m a Senior at the DigiPen Institute of Technology majoring
		in Computer Science in Real-Time Interactive Simulation. I’ve been building software for years, including games, game engines, web apps and mobile apps.

	<p>
		Recently, I've been delving into the realm of full-stack development, and I hope to combine my knowledge of game development with web development to create
		immersive web experiences.

		I love technology, video games, and building software, as well as an interest in artificial intelligence and virtual reality.
