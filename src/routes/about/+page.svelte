	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>
		Hello there. My name is Lee Jia Keat, I am a graduate of the DigiPen Institute of Technology Singapore (and Singapore Institute of Technology)
		majoring in Computer Science in Real-Time Interactive Simulation. I have been building software through academic projects
		for years, including games, game engines, web apps and mobile apps.
	</p>
	<p>
		I like to dabble in anything that interests me.<br>As a result, I have some knowledge in a variety of software development fields, which I hope to be able to combine to create amazing things.
	</p>
	<p>I love technology and building software.<br/>Currently, I specialize in Gameplay Programming, and am a part-time Game Programmer at RATHSOFT.</p>
	<p>My path as a software engineer started with video games.<br>
		I started playing video games from a young age, and my fascination with them led me to their
		technical side through custom maps, modding, server administration, etc.
