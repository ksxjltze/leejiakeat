	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>
		Hello there. My name is Lee Jia Keat, I am a Senior at the DigiPen Institute of Technology Singapore (and Singapore Institute of Technology)
		majoring in Computer Science in Real-Time Interactive Simulation. I have been building software through academic projects
		for years, including games, game engines, web apps and mobile apps.
	</p>
	<p>
		I like to dabble in anything that interests me.<br>As a result, I have some knowledge in a variety of software development fields, which I hope to be able to combine to create beautiful things.
	</p>
	<p>I love technology and building software.</p>
	<p>When it comes to what inspired me to go down this path, I believe it would be video games.<br>
		I started playing video games from a young age, and my fascination with them led me to their
		technical side through custom maps, modding, server administration, etc.
