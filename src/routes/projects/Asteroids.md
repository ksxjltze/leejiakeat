Shooter game inspired by the classic arcade game of the same name.<br>
This project was built for the CSD1400 module: Software Engineering Project 1, otherwise known as GAM100 (Team Size: 4).
This game was the first game that I built at the DigiPen Institute of Technology Singapore.

## Features
Building on top of the classic Asteroids game, new elements were added for a twist:
- Progressively Scaling Difficulty (Inspired by Risk of Rain)
- Currency, Upgrades Shop
- Powerups
- Final Boss
- Super Asteroids (really big asteroids)
- Splitting Asteroids
- Skins
- Leaderboard
- Difficulty Settings
- Random Environment Obstacle Events
- Fuel System

## Tools and Libraries used:
- Microsoft Visual Studio: IDE of choice for building the game.
- CProcessing: C graphics, audio and game development framework.
- Paint.NET: Sprite and image editing.
