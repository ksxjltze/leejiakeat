2D Vertical Scrolling Rhythm Game beatmap player and editor.
Heavily inspired by osu's mania gamemode and its beatmap format.

This project was developed for the Capstone Project module at Ngee Ann Polytechnic and developed using the Unity game engine.
As a programmer in a team of 3, I was responsible for coding the main gameplay logic and beatmap editor.
The beatmap format is a simplified version of osu!mania's beatmap format, and stored as a CSV file.
