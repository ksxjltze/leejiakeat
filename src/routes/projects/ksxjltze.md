Old portfolio website.<br>
This main purpose of developing this project was to build on my fundamental front-end development (and writing) skills.

Hosted on GitHub pages and built using Jekyll.
HTML, CSS and Markdown are used to build pages while Liquid templating is used to populate page content.
