Old portfolio website.<br>
Intended to be a personal portfolio website, future plans may include a 3D project showroom using WebGL or moving to a React-based environment.
This main purpose of developing this project is to build on my fundamental front-end development (and writing) skills.

Hosted on GitHub pages and built using Jekyll.
HTML, CSS and Markdown are used to build pages while Liquid templating is used to populate page content.
