This website.
I wanted to try a UI framework, and SvelteKit happened to catch my eye at the time.

Other than iterating on my previous work at <a href="https://ksxjltze.github.io">ksxjltze.github.io</a>, I wanted to try creating an immersive web experience using WebGL or ThreeJS.

This project is intended to serve as both a portfolio website, as well as my own personal world or sandbox which I can cram random ideas into.
